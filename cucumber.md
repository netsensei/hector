'''Cucumber''' (''Cucumis sativus'') is a widely-cultivated [[Vine#Horticultural climbing plants|creeping vine]] plant in the [[Cucurbitaceae]] family that bears usually cylindrical [[Fruit|fruits]], which are used as [[vegetable]]s.<ref name=":0">"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/145850/cucumber Cucumber]." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. [1998] 2019.</ref> Considered an annual plant,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Silvertown |first1=Jonathan |title=Survival, Fecundity and Growth of Wild Cucumber, Echinocystis Lobata |journal=Journal of Ecology |date=1985 |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=841–849 |doi=10.2307/2260151|jstor=2260151 }}</ref> there are three main varieties of cucumber — slicing, [[Pickled cucumber|pickling]], and burpless/[[Seedless fruit|seedless]] — within which several [[cultivar]]s have been created. The cucumber originates from [[South Asia]], but now grows on most [[continent]]s, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the [[global market]]. In [[North America]], the term ''[[wild cucumber]]'' refers to plants in the [[Genus|genera]] ''[[Echinocystis]]'' and ''[[Marah (plant)|Marah]]'', though the two are not closely related.

== Description ==
The cucumber is a [[Vine#Horticultural climbing plants|creeping vine]] that roots in the ground and grows up [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellises]] or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling [[tendrils]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P43fDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|title=''Cucumis sativus'', Cucumber; Chapter 16 in: Unconventional Oilseeds and Oil Sources|last1=Mariod|first1=Abdalbasit Adam|last2=Mirghani|first2=Mohamed Elwathig Saeed|last3=Hussein|first3=Ismail Hassan|date=2017-04-14|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780128134337}}</ref> The plant may also root in a [[Soilless gardening|soilless medium]], whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large leaves that form a [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] over the fruits.{{Cn|date=February 2021}}

The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as {{convert|62|cm|in|sp=us}} long and {{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us|0}} in diameter.<ref name="ZhangLi2019">{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Tingting|last2=Li|first2=Xvzhen|last3=Yang|first3=Yuting|last4=Guo|first4=Xiao|last5=Feng|first5=Qin|last6=Dong|first6=Xiangyu|last7=Chen|first7=Shuxia|title=Genetic analysis and QTL mapping of fruit length and diameter in a cucumber (''Cucumber sativus'' L.) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population|journal=Scientia Horticulturae|volume=250|year=2019|pages=214–222|doi=10.1016/j.scienta.2019.01.062|s2cid=92837522}}</ref>

Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table). In [[Botany|botanical]] terms, the cucumber is classified as a [[pepo (botany)|''pepo'']], a type of [[Berry (botany)|botanical berry]] with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. However, much like [[Tomato|tomatoes]] and [[Cucurbita|squashes]], it is often perceived, prepared, and eaten as a [[vegetable]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://fruitorvegetable.science/cucumber | title = Cucumber | website = Fruit or Vegetable? | access-date=2019-12-05 }}</ref>

Most cucumber cultivars are seeded and require pollination. For this purpose, thousands of [[Honey bee|honey]] [[Beehive|beehives]] are annually carried to cucumber fields just before bloom. Cucumbers may also be pollinated via [[bumblebee]]s and several other bee species. Most cucumbers that require pollination are [[Self incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]], thus requiring the [[pollen]] of another plant in order to form [[Seed|seeds]] and fruit.<ref name="Nonnecke">{{cite book |author=Nonnecke, I.L. |year=1989  |title=Vegetable Production |publisher=Springer  |isbn=9780442267216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7i8QJw8BJsC }}</ref> Some self-compatible cultivars exist that are related to the '[[Lemon]]' cultivar.<ref name="Nonnecke" /> 

A few [[cultivar]]s of cucumber are [[Parthenocarpy|parthenocarpic]], the [[Blossom|blossoms]] of which create [[seedless fruit]] without [[pollination]], which degrades the eating quality of these cultivar. In the [[Agriculture in the United States|United States]], these are usually grown in [[greenhouse]]s, where [[Bee|bees]] are excluded. In [[Europe]], they are grown outdoors in some regions, where bees are likewise excluded.{{Cn|date=February 2021}}

Traditional cultivars produce male blossoms first, then female, in about equivalent numbers. Newer [[gynoecious]] hybrid cultivars produce almost all female blossoms. They may have a [[pollenizer]] cultivar interplanted, and the number of beehives per unit area is increased, but temperature changes induce male flowers even on these plants, which may be sufficient for pollination to occur.<ref name="Nonnecke" />

In 2009, an international team of researchers announced they had sequenced the cucumber [[genome]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=S.|last2=Li|first2=R.|last3=Zhang|first3=Z.|last4=Li|first4=L.|last5=Gu|first5=X.|last6=Fan|first6=W.|last7=Lucas|first7=W.|last8=Wang|first8=X.|last9=Xie|first9=B.|last10=Ni|first10=P.|last11=Ren|first11=Y.|display-authors=4|year=2009|title=The genome of the cucumber, ''Cucumis sativus'' L|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=41|issue=12|pages=1275–81|doi=10.1038/ng.475|pmid=19881527|doi-access=free|first28=J.|first26=G.|last27=Lu|first27=Y.|last28=Ruan|first12=H.|last29=Qian|first29=W.|last30=Wang|first30=M.|first25=Y.|last26=Tian|last25=Ren|last13=Li|first18=J.|first13=J.|last14=Lin|first14=K.|last15=Jin|first15=W.|last16=Fei|first16=Z.|last17=Li|first17=G.|last18=Staub|last12=Zhu|first24=Z.|first19=A.|last20=Van Der Vossen|first20=E.

== Varieties ==
{{See also|List of cucumber varieties}}
In general [[Agriculture|cultivation]], cucumbers are classified into three main [[cultivar]] groups: slicing, [[Pickled cucumber|pickled]], and [[Seedless fruit|seedless/burpless]].

=== Slicing ===

Cucumbers grown to eat fresh are called ''slicing cucumbers''. The main varieties of slicers mature on [[Vine|vines]] with large leaves that provide shading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almanac.com/plant/cucumbers|title=Cucumbers: Planting, growing, and harvesting cucumbers|publisher=Old Farmer's Almanac, Yankee Publishing, Inc., Dublin, NH|date=2016|access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref> 

Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color, and have much tougher skin. In contrast, those in other countries, often called [[European cucumber|'''European cucumbers''']], are smaller and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus are often being sold in plastic skin for protection. This variety may also be called a '''telegraph cucumber''', particularly in [[Australasia]].<ref>[http://www.5aday.co.nz/facts-and-tips/fruit-vegetable-info/cucumber/ Cucumber – 5+ a day, New Zealand] Retrieved 18 May 2018</ref>

=== Pickling ===
{{Main|Pickled cucumber}}

[[pickled cucumber|Pickling]] with [[Pickled cucumber#Brined pickles|brine]], sugar, [[vinegar]], and spices creates various flavored products from cucumbers and other foods.<ref name="avi">{{cite web|author1=Avi, Torey|title=History in a jar: The story of pickles|url=http://www.pbs.org/food/the-history-kitchen/history-pickles/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|access-date=13 November 2017|date=3 September 2014}}</ref> Although any cucumber can be pickled, commercial pickles are made from cucumbers specially bred for uniformity of length-to-diameter ratio and lack of voids in the flesh. Those cucumbers intended for pickling, called '''picklers''', grow to about {{convert|7|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} long and {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} wide. Compared to slicers, picklers tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines. Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.{{Cn|date=February 2021}}

==== Gherkin ====

[[Pickled cucumber#Gherkin|Gherkins]], also called '''cornichons''',<ref name="kitchn">{{cite web|title=What's The Deal With Cornichons?|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-deal-with-cornichons-117240|publisher=The Kitchn|access-date=13 November 2017|date=2017}}</ref> or '''baby pickles''', are small cucumbers, typically those {{convert|1|to|5|in|cm|round=0.5|order=flip}} in length, often with bumpy skin, which are typically used for pickling.<ref name="zon">{{cite web|title=Gherkins|url=http://www.royalzon.com/en/consumer/fruit-vegetables/gherkins|publisher=Zon|access-date=13 November 2017|location=Venlo, Netherlands|date=2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114040538/http://www.royalzon.com/en/consumer/fruit-vegetables/gherkins|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="wifss">{{cite web|title=Cucumbers|url=http://www.wifss.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FDA_WIFSS_-Cucumbers_PDF.pdf|publisher=Western Institute for Food Safety and Security, US Department of Agriculture|access-date=13 November 2017|location=University of California-Davis|date=May 2016}}</ref><ref name="india">{{cite web|title=Cucumbers and gherkins|url=http://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/SubHead_Products/Cucumber_and_Gherkins.htm|publisher=Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, Government of India|access-date=13 November 2017|date=2015}}</ref> The word ''gherkin'' comes from the early modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''gurken'' or ''augurken'' ('small pickled cucumber').<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=Word origin and history for gherkin|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gherkin|dictionary=Dictionary.com|access-date=13 November 2017|date=2017}}</ref> The term is also used in the name for ''[[Cucumis anguria]]'', the ''West Indian gherkin'', a closely related species.<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indian gherkin, ''Cucumis anguria'' L.|url=http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cucumis+anguria|publisher=Plants for a Future|access-date=13 November 2017|date=2012}}</ref>

=== Burpless ===

Burpless cucumbers are sweeter and have a thinner skin than other varieties of cucumber. They are reputed to be easy to digest and to have a pleasant taste. They can grow as long as {{convert|2|ft|cm|sp=us|order=flip|-1}}, are nearly seedless, and have a delicate skin. Most commonly grown in greenhouses, these [[parthenocarpic]] cucumbers are often found in [[Grocery store|grocery markets]], [[Shrink wrap|shrink-wrapped]] in plastic. They are marketed as either burpless or seedless, as the seeds and skin of other varieties of cucumbers are said to give some people gas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jordan-Reilly|first=Melissa|title=Why do cucumbers upset my digestion?|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/471722-why-do-cucumbers-upset-my-digestion/|publisher=LiveStrong.com|date=15 September 2013 }}</ref>

== Cultivation history ==

Cultivated for at least 3,000 years, the cucumber originated from [[Agriculture in India|India]], where a great many varieties have been observed, along with its closest living relative, ''[[Cucumis hystrix]]''.<ref>[[Asian News International]]. 21 July 2010. "[http://newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/170033 Cucumber, melon's common ancestor originated in Asia]." ''NewsTrack India.'' Retrieved on 4 June 2020.</ref> It was probably introduced to Europe by the [[Agriculture in ancient Greece|Greeks]] or [[Agriculture in ancient Rome|Romans]].

=== Roman Empire ===
According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the Emperor [[Tiberius]] had the cucumber on his table daily during summer and winter. In order to have it available for his table every day of the year, the Romans reportedly used artificial methods of growing (similar to the [[Greenhouse|greenhouse system]]), whereby ''mirrorstone'' refers to Pliny's ''lapis specularis'', believed to have been sheet [[mica]]:<ref name="AncientInventions">{{cite book|author1=James, Peter J. |author2=Thorpe, Nick |author3=Thorpe, I.

Reportedly, they were also cultivated in ''specularia'', cucumber houses glazed with oiled cloth.<ref name="AncientInventions" /> Pliny describes the Italian fruit as very small, probably like a [[gherkin]]. He also describes the preparation of a medication known as ''elaterium''. However, some scholars{{who|date=February 2013}} believe that he was instead referring to ''[[Ecballium elaterium]]'', known in pre-[[Linnean nomenclature|Linnean]] times as ''Cucumis silvestris'' or ''Cucumis asininus'' ('wild cucumber' or 'donkey cucumber'), a species different from the common cucumber.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XX.[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&getid=1&query=Plin.%20Nat.%2020.3 iii].</ref>  Pliny also writes about several other varieties of cucumber, including the cultivated cucumber,<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XX.[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&getid=1&query=Plin.%20Nat.%2020.4 iv]–[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&getid=1&query=Plin.%20Nat.%2020.5 v].</ref> and remedies from the different types (9 from the cultivated; 5 from the "anguine;" and 26 from the "wild").

=== Middle Ages ===
[[Charlemagne]] had cucumbers grown in his gardens in the 8th/9th century. They were reportedly introduced into England in the early 14th century, lost, then reintroduced approximately 250 years later. The [[Spaniards]] (through the [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Christopher Columbus]]) brought cucumbers to [[Haiti]] in 1494. In 1535, [[Jacques Cartier]], a French explorer, found "very great cucumbers" grown on the site of what is now [[Montreal]].{{Cn|date=February 2021}}

Throughout the 16th century, European trappers, traders, [[bison]] hunters, and explorers bartered for the products of American Indian [[agriculture]]. The tribes of the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] learned from the Spanish how to grow European crops.  The farmers on the Great Plains included the [[Mandan]] and [[Abenaki]]. They obtained cucumbers and [[watermelon]]s from the Spanish, and added them to the crops they were already growing, including several varieties of [[Maize|corn]] and [[bean]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[gourd]] plants.<ref>{{cite book|title=Taste, Memory: Forgotten Foods, Lost Flavors, and why They Matter|pages=109|last=Buchanan|first=David|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=VT, USA|isbn=9781603584401|year=2012}}</ref> The [[Iroquois]] were also growing them when the first Europeans visited them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Traditional Plant Foods of Canadian Indigenous Peoples: Nutrition, Botany and Use|pages=159|last1=Kuhnlein|first1=H.

In 1630, the Reverend [[Francis Higginson]] produced a book called ''New-Englands Plantation'' in which, describing a garden on Conant's Island in [[Boston Harbor]] known as ''The Governor's Garden'', he states:<ref>[[Francis Higginson|Higginson, Francis]].

In the later 17th century, a prejudice developed against uncooked vegetables and fruits. A number of articles in contemporary health publications stated that uncooked plants brought on summer diseases and should be forbidden to children. The cucumber kept this reputation for an inordinate period of time, "fit only for consumption by cows," which some believe is why it gained the name, ''cowcumber''.{{Cn|date=February 2021}}

[[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary on 22 August 1663:<ref>[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1663/08/22/ Saturday 22 August 1663 (Pepys' Diary)]. Pepysdiary.com. Retrieved on 25 November 2012.</ref><blockquote>[T]his day Sir W. Batten tells me that Mr. Newburne is dead of eating cowcumbers, of which the other day I heard of another, I think.</blockquote>

A copper [[etching]] made by Maddalena Bouchard between 1772 and 1793 shows this plant to have smaller, almost bean-shaped fruits, and small yellow flowers. The small form of the cucumber is figured in [[Herbal|Herbals]] of the 16th century, however stating that "[i]f hung in a tube while in blossom, the Cucumber will grow to a most surprising length."{{Cn|date=February 2021}}
